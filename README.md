# Progtester
Progtester tests your program against the tests provided by the teacher and returns the results. If test fails it returns the diff of your files.

**It is opinionated by default.**
Every progtests exercise must be in its own folder and your script must be named ``main.c``.
In that folder there must be a ``tests`` folder.

-- progtest_exercise_1<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-- tests<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;main.c
   
It's in very early stage so any new Pull requests are welcomed!
